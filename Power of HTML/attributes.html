  <h1 style="color:darkcyan">HTML Attributes</h1>
  <h2>Some attributes only work on certain elements - for example, the datetime attribute only works on the time element.</h2>
  <h2>Other attributes work on several of the elements, but not all of them.</h2>
  <h1 style="color:darkcyan">Global Attributes</h1>
  <h2> Global attributes can be applied to any HTML element</h2>
  <h3 style="color:lightcoral">The 4 Most Useful Attributes</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>The class Attribute</b></dt>
      <dd>Allows us to target <strong>all elements with that class</strong> in our CSS or JavaScript</b></dd>
      <dd>&lt;p class="intro"&gt;This is the introduction&lt;p&gt;</dd>
    <dt><b>The id Attribute</b></dt>
      <dd>Allows us to target <strong>a unique element with that id</strong> in our CSS or JavaScript</b></dd>
      <dd>&lt;p class="intro" id="article-intro"&gt;This is the introduction&lt;p&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>The lang Attribute</b></dt>
      <dd>The Lang Attribute gives us a way to tell the browser what language the content is in. Markup: lang="language-code</dd>
      <dd>&lt;p lang="en-GB">This paragraph is in British English.&lt;/p&gt;</dd>
      <dd>&lt;p lang="fr">Ce paragraphe defini en francais.&lt;/p&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>The dir Attribute</b></dt>
      <dd>The DIR attribute tells the browser in which direction the text flows.</dd>
      <dd>&lt;p dir="ltr">This paragraph is in English. It flows from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;</dd>
      <dd>&lt;p dir="rtl">Other languages flow from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <h2>The contenteditable="true" attribute lets visitors edit the content of that page.</h2>
  <cite contenteditable="true">Your name here</cite>
 
  <h1 style="color:darkcyan">ARIA Roles</h1>
  <h2>ARIA roles are another kind of attribute that can be added to any HTML element to give it more meaning and to make sure the browser understands what something is.</h2>
  <h3>Ideally, we won't need an ARIA role. If we use the proper HTML element, we'll communicate the right message about the semantics of the content.</h3>
  <h2> ARIA Roles: HTML attributes that provide accessible information about that specific element</h2>
  <h3>The layer of information conveyed by ARIA tells screen readers, braille displays, magnifiers, and other assistive technology things they need to know to make a site fully accessible.</h3>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <h1 aria-label="Hello World">
    <div class="grid" aria-hidden="true">
      <span>H</span>
      <span>E</span>
      <span>L</span>
      <span>L</span>
      <span>O</span>

      <span>W</span>
      <span>O</span>
      <span>R</span>
      <span>L</span>
      <span>D</span>

<h1 style="color:darkcyan">Formatting HTML</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For the most part, HTML doesn't care about spaces, tabs, new lines. Exceptions: pre element, code element, textarea element, or if you use <br>
    CSS to change how the whitespace is handled - in those cases extra spaces, returns and indentations can count. But, most of the time, <br>
    the browser will ignore everything having to do with spacing beyond the presence of a single space. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding comments to code can make it easier to understand what the code is doing.</p>
    <p>&lt;!-- <b>Comments start with a < sign followed by !--, they end with --></b> --&gt;</p>
    <!-- Adding comments to code can make it easier to understand what the code is doing. -->
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When HTML was first created, uppercase letters were used to denote tags. Now we use lowercase. <br>
    But, it doesn't actually matter for browser readibility. But, everyone uses lowercase now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some elements have an short abbreviation, like p or i. Others, like article and video are full words. <br>
      Why? HTML was invented in the early 80s/90s, when computer scientists needed to save memory space, <br>
      so they only used initial abbreviations of words. Now, with the newer elements that have been added, <br>
      we have more memory storage capability, so we can use full words to make code easily readble and understandable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do we have a closing tag or not? The newer HTML elements always have an opening and a closing tag. <br>
      Sometimes you don't put anything between an opening and closing tag. But, for some older elements, <br>
      there is no closing tag, like image. People used to think that if it didn't need a closing tag, why have one? <br>
      Later, best practice said to put a slash at the end of a tag that doesn't have a closing tag. <br>
      The ideas is that the element kind of opens and closes itself, all at once. <br>
      Now, it really doesn't matter if you have the closing slash or not.</p>
  </li>
 
</ul>

<h1 style="color:darkcyan">Weird Characters</h1>
<h3>The > sign, the < sign, and the & are part of the characters that we use to write HTML. So, what happens when we want to use them in our content?</h3>
<p>When you write the > or < or & signs with spaces around them, they will show up as content. <br>
  But, if you start to write something that might look like an html element, it disappears. <br>
  The browser thinks it should do this as part of html instead of displaying it.</p>
  <h3>You can handle this using an HTML Entity</h3>
  <h3>HTML Entity Format: Ampersand, short code, semicolon (no spaces between them)</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Entity:  & lt; (but with no spaces <!-- &lt;-->)</dt>
    <dd>Character:   < </dd>
    <dt>Entity: & gt; (but with no spaces <!-- &gt;-->)</dt>
    <dd>Character: > </dd>
    <dt>Entity:  & amp; (but with no spaces <!-- &amp;-->)</dt>
    <dd>Character: & </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>HTML Entities can also be helpful for typing characters that aren't on your keyboard</h3>
  <h4>Copyright: &copy;</h4>
  <h4>Trademark: &trade;</h4>
  <h4>Star: &star;</h4>
  <h3>You don't have to use the character entity. You can just copy and paste the character or learn the keyboard command for it.</h3>
  <h3>Non-Breaking Space Entity</h3>
  <h4>Normally, spaces provide opportunities for lines of text to wrap. The words stay whole, and when there's not enough room, <br>
    the browswer looks for a place to wrap the line of text. It looks for any space where there's a space between words.<br>
    But, we can insert a non-breaking space between two words, instead of a regular space, and the browser will know NOT to break the line there:</h4>

    <h4>Example: Your name is in a phrase and you want to never have your last name separated onto a new line from your first name. <br>
      You can type & nbsp; (but no space between & n)for non breaking space.</h4>
      <p>Here is a sentence that will break between every word, including between Rachel&nbsp;Scott.</p>
      <h4> You can also use the non-breaking space entity to force the browser to put more than one space between words.</h4>
      <p>Here's an example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people put multiple spaces between every sentence. &nbsp;&nbsp; Like and animal&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer is not a typewriter.</p>
