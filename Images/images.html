  <h2>Four Attributes of an Image Element</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>1. Source Attribute: src="img.jpg"</b></dt>
    <dd>
      The source attribute tells the browser which image file to load.
    </dd>
    
    <dt><b>2. Alternative Attribute: alt="black dog"</b></dt>
    <dd>
      The alt attribute acts as a substitute for the image whenever the image can't be seen. <br>
      For example, people who are blind may use a screen reader where the ALT text is read aloud to them.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Some images don't need an explanation. Like a logo. In these cases, include the alt tag, but leave it empty. <br>
      If not, the file name for the image might get read aloud. 
    </dd>
    <dt><b>3. Width Attribue: width="400"</b></dt>
    <dd>Let the browser know how wide the image is in pixels. We don't include the unit px. It's understood to mean pixels.</dd>
    <dt><b>4. Height Attribute: height="300"</b></dt>
    <dd>Let the browser know how tall the image is in pixels. We don't include the unit px. It's understood to mean pixels.</dd>
    <dt><b>Why include the width and height if the image appears the size we want it to? </b></dt>
    <dd>
      Once the file is already loaded and on the page, the width and height attributes don't do anything.<br>
      The browser figured out how big to display the image by downloading it, looking at the file and its characteristics, <br>
      and using that to calculate the layout. The problem is, if the browser has to get the size information out of the file, <br>
      then it can't calculate this part of the layout until after the image has downloaded. If instead we tell the browser how big each image is,<br>
      then it knows immediately and that gives the browser a split second head start in calculating the layout.<br>
      Including the width and height attributes will prevent a webpage from jumping around as images load, moving everything as you're trying to read.
    </dd>
