  <h2> Image Tag/Element: &lt;img&gt;</h2>
  <!-- <img> -->
  <h2>Four Attributes of an Image Element</h2>
  <dl >
    <dt><b>1. Source Attribute: src="img.jpg"</b></dt>
    <dd>
      The source attribute tells the browser which image file to load.
    </dd>
    
    <dt><b>2. Alternative Attribute: alt="black dog"</b></dt>
    <dd>
      The alt attribute acts as a substitute for the image whenever the image can't be seen. <br>
      For example, people who are blind may use a screen reader where the ALT text is read aloud to them.
    </dd>
    <dd>
      Some images don't need an explanation. Like a logo. In these cases, include the alt tag, but leave it empty. <br>
      If not, the file name for the image might get read aloud. 
    </dd>
    <dt><b>3. Width Attribue: width="400"</b></dt>
    <dd>Let the browser know how wide the image is in pixels. We don't include the unit px. It's understood to mean pixels.</dd>
    <dt><b>4. Height Attribute: height="300"</b></dt>
    <dd>Let the browser know how tall the image is in pixels. We don't include the unit px. It's understood to mean pixels.</dd>
    <dt><b>Why include the width and height if the image appears the size we want it to? </b></dt>
    <dd>
      Once the file is already loaded and on the page, the width and height attributes don't do anything.<br>
      The browser figured out how big to display the image by downloading it, looking at the file and its characteristics, <br>
      and using that to calculate the layout. The problem is, if the browser has to get the size information out of the file, <br>
      then it can't calculate this part of the layout until after the image has downloaded. If instead we tell the browser how big each image is,<br>
      then it knows immediately and that gives the browser a split second head start in calculating the layout.<br>
      Including the width and height attributes will prevent a webpage from jumping around as images load, moving everything as you're trying to read.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Image Element with all 4 Attributes:</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/14518598/pexels-photo-14518598.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1" 
            alt="Drinking cocoa outside a cabin" 
            width="400"
            height="500">
    </dd>
  </dl>


  <h1 style="color:darkcyan">Image Formats</h1>
  <p>
    To put an image on a webpage, it has to be in a file format that web browsers understand. There are several options. <br>
    We keep inventing new ones in a quest for the perfect balance between tiny file sizes and gorgeous-looking images. <br>
    We want as much data as possible, so that it'll look amazing. <br>
    But we want as little data as possible so images will download faster and not eat through people's data plans.
  </p>
  <p><b>Goal: High Quality + Small File Size</b></p>
<p>Each fule format takes a different approach to solving this. <br>
  Each uses a different technique for compressing the image.</p>
  <h2>Four Main File Formats</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>GIF</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>GIF = Graphics Interchange Format</li>
        <li>The GIF is one of the oldest.</li>
        <li>Good at compressing illustrations that have large areas of a single color</li>
        <li>Limited color space of 256 colors (This can make photographs pixelated) - Bad choice for photographs</li>
        <li>Can do transparency, with jagged edges</li>
        <li>Can have multiple frames, and make a little movie</li>
      </ul>
    <li><b>SVG</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>SVG = Scalable Vector Graphic</li>
      <li> Great for logos, icons, and other kinds of illustration.</li>
      <li>Vector file (instead of pixels) - - It contains instructions for a drawing (e.g. Make a square, make it this color, put it here.</li>
      <li>Because SVGs are made of vector and math, these images can scale to be physically quite large or very small without losing any quality. This makes the file size very small.</li>
      <li>If you can use an SVG, you definitely should.</li>
      <li>SVGs can be exported from Illustrator, Sketch, or other vector graphics programs</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>JPG</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Image format for compressing photos</li>
      <li>Most digital cameras save photos that you shoot as JPG files.</li>
      <li>When you put a JPG image on the web, make sure that either a human or robot resizes the image to an appropriate physical size<br>
         and compresses it for the web. (Don't just stick a 5000 pixel wide, half-compressed JPG on your website. <br>
         They are far too big for users to download and will make your site very slow.)</li>
      <li>Can be compressed to much smaller sizes by simplifying the color info in the file.</li>
      <li>Pick a balance between Size vs. Quality   - - You can do that manually or rely on your web service to handle the task.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>PNG</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Good solution when you have a photograph AND you need part of the photo to be transparent.</li>
      <li>Good at compression illustrastions</li>
      <li>Good at compressing photos and images</li>
      <li>Depends on the use case - - - If you're manually compressing files, you should try several options and see which results in the smaller file.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <h3>
    Consider the physical size of an image, the file format and teh compressing settings when making your image files.<br>
    Aim to make them download as fast as possible.
