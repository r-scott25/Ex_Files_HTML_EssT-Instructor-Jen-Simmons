    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Audio</h1>

    <h2>Audio Tag/Element: &lt;audio&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</h2>
    <!-- <audio> -->
    <p>
      The HTML can trigger the browser to create an entire audio player or
      interface for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio element has both an opening and closing tag. It uses a source
      attribute to provide the URL to the file
    </p>
    <p>The <b>controls attribute</b> provides the ability to play, pause, change the volume, see the time code, and jump around in the timeline.</p>
    <p>The <b>loop attribute</b> will make the file loop. When it gets to the end, it starts playing from the beginning again.</p>
    <p>The <b>autoplay attribute</b> will cause the audio to be played automatically as soon as the page loads, at least in some browsers. <br>
      Be careful with autoplay. Most people hate it when the audio starts playing automatically.</p> 
    <audio
      controls src="birds.mp3" loop autoplay>
    </audio>

    <p>Use the <b>source element</b> is used to specify more than one audio file. <br>
      Pehaps you want to use a new file format that's not supported in every browser while providing a fallback for the older browsers.<br>
      Instead of putting the file link in a source attribute, put it in a source element:</p>
      <audio controls loop autoplay>
        <source src="birds.ogg"
                type="audio/ogg codec=opus">
        <source src="birs.mp3"
                type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <p><b>MP3s</b> are supported in most modern browsers. <b>OGG</b> is another file format that had some advantages, but it never became very popular. A new file format may be coming out soon.</p>
    <h3>Syntax for Supporting Multiple Media File Formats</h3>
    <p>We can make multiple files and list them in separate source elements. The browser will use the first file that it understands in the list.<br>
       You can also provide some fallback text that will only be displayed if the audio element is not understood by the browser at all. </p>
    <audio controls loop autoplay>
      <source src="birds.ogg"
              type="audio/ogg codec=opus">
      <source src="birs.mp3"
              type="audio/mpeg">
              Sorry, your browser doesn't support this audio file.
  </audio>

  <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Video</h1>

  <h2>Video Tag/Element: &lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</h2>

  <p>Use the <b>source attribute</b> to point to a video file.</p>
  <p>Use the <b>controls attribute</b> to create a video player.</p>

  <video src="exampleVideo.mp4" controls></video>

  <p><b>PROBLEM TO SOLVE: </b>For the simples version of this demo, I've made a video file that 480p compressed using the H.264 codec delivered <br>
     as an MP4 file. 480p means that there are 480 lines of resolution or 720 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall. It's standard depth, not HD, not 4K. <br>
     I'm using the H.264 coded because it has the widest support across browsers at the moment, much like choosing between PNG, JPEG, GIF, or SVG <br>
     for images, there are a bunch of different codecs which a video file might be encoded. Video files contain A LOT OF DATA and can get incredibly <br>
     big when they aren't compressed, far too big to travel across the internet. So, any internet video is using a pretty hefty mechanism for smashing<br>
      all of that data into the smallest possible package.</p>
      <p><b>There have been many attempts to make the Ultimate Codec:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real Video</li>
        <li>Sorenson</li>
        <li>Windoes Media</li>
        <li>Flash (FLV)</li>
        <li>H.263</li>
      </ul>
      <p>From about 2016-2020, the H.264 is the one that's dominated. It's the codec that most of us are using most of the time. <br>
        But, it's not open source. It's patented. It's owned by a consortium that charges fees, and they are about to charge way more.</p>

      <p>To fix this, a lot of effort has gone into creatig a truly open, not patented, but still awesome, video codec</p>
      <p>Folks had hoped that <b>WebM</b> would emerge the winner, but it's still unclear if it will.</p>
      <p>More recently, there's hope that we've solved this with <b>AV1</b>. It's looking like AV1 is a better codec that H.264, and is royalty free.</p>
      <p>Multiple File Types: This works the same way as it does for the audio and picture elements. We use the source element to list the <br>
        multiple file formats, with the source attribute to link to the file, and the type attribute to tell the browser which type of file it is. <br>
        The browser will play the first file that it understands.</p>
      <p><b>PROBLEM TO SOLVE: </b>There's nothing in HTML that will allow us to send different sizes of videos under different network conditions <br>
        (resolution, screen size). In part, that's because we don't want the device to get oonly one moment to make a choice between, say, standard <br>
        def and high def. We want it to make that choice over and over again. Maybe someone has an HD screen, but the network is kind of slow, so instead<br>
         of sending them a 1080p file, we want to send them a 720 video, but then, as soon as their network speed improves, we want to switch from 720 <br>
         to 1080. This is how Netflix, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, Vimeo, and all those TV apps work. They are constantly switching from one resolution to another<br>
          as people watch, using a technique called <b>adaptive bitrate streaming</b>. It requires a server farm of transcoding robots, which is why <br>
          <b>when you go to put video on a website, it's likely you might not use the video element. There's a good chance you'll use embed code from a <br>
            video hosting service</b>.</p>

    

    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Captions and Subtitles</h1>
    <p>Use captions and subtitles to make the video content more accessible to everyone, and in many places are required by law.</p>
    <p>Do this by using the <b>track element</b>.</p>
    <p>The video player will provide all the functionality so a viewer can turn captioning on and off or switch from one set of subtitles to another.</p>
    <h3>webvtt = web video text tracks</h3>
    <p>webvtt is basically a plain text file with a vtt extension that uses a certain convention for providing the information.</p>
    <p>To get these captions to show up on our video we put the track element inside the video element. Just like the source elements, it's part of <br>
      the list of options for the browser to use while rendering the video player. On the track element, we'll use the <b>source attribute</b> to point to <br>
      the file itself. We'll use the <b>kind</b> attribute to tell the browser that this is captions. We'll add a <b>label</b> of english that will show up in <br>
      the player as a label for this choice. We'll use a <b>srclang attribute</b> to specify which language this is. And we'll put a <b>default attribute</b> on <br>
      this track element to specify that this track is the one we want to use by default when a user turns on captions.Now, I'll add a translation <br>
      into Spanish and offer some options for subtitles. I've got another vtt file this time in Spanish. And we'll add another track element inside <br>
      the same video element. This time, we'll set kind to subtitles.</p>
    <video controls>
      <source src="moonwalk.ogg"
              type="audio/ogg codec=opus">
      <source src="moonwalk.mp3"
              type="audio/mpeg">
      <track src="moonwalk.vtt" 
              kind="captions"
              label="English"
              srclang="en"
              default>
              <track src="moonwalk.vtt" 
              kind="subtitles"
              label="Espanol"
              srclang="es"
              default>
              <p>This would be a video of a moonwalk, if your device supported playing the video.</p>
  </video>

  <p>There are other options for the <b>kind attribute</b>.</p>
  <p> We could create a vtt file that has descriptive information about what's happening <br>
    visually in the video, and use <b>kind="descriptions"</b>.</p>
    <p><b>Kind="chapters"</b> gives us a way to provide a text file that lists the chapters in the video, giving users a way to jump from one <br>
      section in the video to another.</p>
