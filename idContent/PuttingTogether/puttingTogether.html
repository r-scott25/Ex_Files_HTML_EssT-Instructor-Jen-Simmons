    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Putting It All Together</h1>
    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">The HTML Page</h1>
    <h3>
      No matter how the website is engineered, the web itself works the same
      every time.
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>URL: A user goes to a URL</li>
      <li>Request: Hitting that URL sends a request for an HTML file</li>
      <li>Response: HTML: A server returns a single HTML file</li>
      <li>The browser reads the HTML file and does what it says</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>HTML file: </b> The first file that's returned in response to a request
      for a webpage
    </p>
    <p>
      When the browser gets that HTML file, it immediately starts reading it
      from top to bottom and starts to do what it says.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top, there's a list of other files (links, scripts). The browser
      immediately requests them, and once it has those files, <br />
      it starts to do the things that those files tell it to do.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Parts that Every Web Page Must Have</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>1. the doctype Declaration</b></dt>
      <dd>Declares which era this HTML file is from</dd>
      <dd>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>2. html Element</b></dt>
      <dd>
        Wrap everything else in the webpage inside the &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
        element
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Place the lang Element and dir Element inside the opening tag of the
        html element
      </dd>
      <dd>Example: &lt;html lang="en-US dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</dd>
      <dt><b>3. head Element</b></dt>
      <dd>Located inside the html element, at the top</dd>
      <dd>
        The head is for all the meta data, all the information the browser needs
        to know, although it won't be displayed
      </dd>
      <dt><b>4. body Element</b></dt>
      <dd>Located inside the html element, after the head</dd>
      <dd>
        The body contains all the information and content that will be displayed
        on the page.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Document head</h1>
    <p>
      In the head, don't put information you want your user to see. Put
      information you want your browser to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>meta Element: </b>Only used inside the head. Conveys metadata about the
      page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;head&gt;<br />
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br />
      &lt;title&gt;Title to Appear on the Browser Tab&lt;/title&gt;<br />
      &lt;/head&gt;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>title Element</b>This is not a title that gets displayed as content.
      This is a title for the webpage that's used by the browser. <br />
      It shows up as the name on a browser tab, or as a bookmark title when
      someone bookmarks it. The name of the page, if it's listed under top sites
      <br />
      when a user opens a new browser. Any place the interface of the browser
      references this page, it uses the title that's defined in the title <br />
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>meta Element</b> can be used to define all kinds of settings.
      <br />
      One incredibly common use is to tell the browser the layout has been
      morphed to fit small screens, that it is a responsive website. <br />
      Without this meta tag, the browser assumes the page is using an older
      technique for layout, that it's a desktop layout that needs to be shrunk
      <br />
      down to fit on a phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We probably also want to add a description of the site. This description
      will show up in search engine results. The meta tag is used to give <br />
      the webpage a name when it's saved to home screen, and to specify tile
      image and a background color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you ever posted a link to Slack, LinkedIn, Twitter, or elsewhere and
      seen that link turn into a great-looking card? That's set up using <br />
      meta tags. There are many techniques for refining and improving the
      experience of your site that all involve the meta tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>link Element</b>. This is used to link to a range of other assets that
      we want to load, like CSS files, fonts, and favicons. <br />
      The <b>rel attribute</b> is used to tell a browser which kind of asset it
      is. And the <b>href attribute</b> is used to provide the URL to <br />
      the asset. The link to a stylesheet looks like this, with the rel
      attribute of stylesheet. A link to a favicon looks like this. <br />
      We can also link to preload a font file. <br />
      One thing to think about, the browser will load the files in the order in
      which they're listed. Put things you want to load first at the top. <br />
      Things that aren't as important or that won't get used right away, they
      can go further down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last commonly used element that goes into an HTML document's head is
      the <b>script tag</b>. This tells the browser to load a JavaScript
      file.<br />
      Actually, a script tag doesn't have to go into the HTML head. Frequently,
      people put it at the end of an HTML document so the browser loads <br />
      JavaScript after everything else has loaded. But sometimes it is included
      in the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML head is a place to get everything connected and set up to make
      sure other assets are loaded and to provide data about the page to other
      sites and platforms. It's the headquarters for starting out the page
      right.

    <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Structuring Content</h1>
    <h2>Six Major Elements for Structuring Content</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>1. main</b></dt>
      <dd>Wraps around the main content of the page</dd>
      <dd>
        Only used once per webpage and tells the browser This is where the main
        content is.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>2. header</b></dt>
      <dd>Used to mark places on the page where the content is a header</dd>
      <dt><b>3. footer</b></dt>
      <dd>Used to mark places on the page where the content is a footer</dd>
      <dt><b>4. article</b></dt>
      <dd>Wrapped around any instance of an article.</dd>
      <dd>
        It might be a long written article or a blog post.It might be a short
        snippet. <br />
        A teaser card can be marked up as an article element. A social media
        post can be an article.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        There could be no words. It can be used to markup an app where each unit
        of stuff is best defined as an article.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>5. section</b></dt>
      <dd>Wraps around sections of content</dd>
      <dd>
        Example: A long essay that's broken up into chuncks with sub headlines,
        we can use the section element to mark each segment.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        We may have zones on our website - a section toward the top that's about
        one topic, another section further down that's about something else.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Section is a flexible element, meaning you can just start with another
        thing.
      </dd>
      <dd>
        Usually each section has its own headline, marking the start of a new
        segment of content.
      </dd>
      <dt><b>6. aside</b></dt>
      <dd>Marks content that is off to the side or not the main attraction</dd>
      <dd>Example: a side bar, an inset panel, advertisements,</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The main element is used once per page to wrap around the main content on
      that page. <br />
      The header, footer, article, section, and aside elements are the five
      sectioning elements in HTML. <br />
      They are used together, nested inside of each other in patterns and
      combinations that give the <br />
      content of a webpage its true structure.
