  <h1 style="color: darkcyan">More Ways to Identify Content</h1>

  <h1 style="color: darkcyan">Supporting Languages</h1>
  <p>There are several tools in HTML we want to use to make sure it's clear which language our content is in. If we set up things properly, <br>
    search engines will know when to list our sites in which language. The right dictionaries will show up for the spell checkers. When content is <br>
    read aloud by a browser, it's more likely that the words will get pronounced properly. We want computers who are involved to know which language <br>
    the content is in.</p>
    <p>The <b>lang attribute</b> is what we use to do this.</p>
    &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
      ...
      &lt;/html&gt;
      <!-- <html lang="en-US">
              ...
      </html> -->
  <p>If our whole page is the same, then it's simple. We can set the language on the outermost element that wraps all the other elements, <br>
    which is the <b>html element</b>.</p>

    <p><b>lang="en-US</b></p>
    <p><b>lang="en-GB</b></p>
    <p>This is especially important for spell-checkers. US = color Great Britain = colour</p>
    <p>There are many options for the value of the lang attribute, not just to convey the language or the region-specific version of a language, <br>
      but to also convey other qualities, like what kind of alphabet is being used to write a language.</p>

      <h3>If your webpage has more than one language on it, specify the language for each particular part of the content. <br>
          The lang attribute is a universal attribute, meaning you can put it on any element</h3>
          <p>Also, specify in which direction our content flows using the <b>dir Attribute</b>.It's a universal attribute that can go on any element.<br>
            If all of the content on your page is the same, define it once on the outer HTML element.</p>
            <p><b>left to right: dir="ltr</b></p>
            <p><b>right to left: dir="rtl</b></p>

            <p>The <b>charset Attribute</b> defines the alphabet or set of characters for the script language.</p>
            <p>Most projects use <b>Unicode, specifically UTF-8</b>, which basically means we encoded all our content into according to this <br>
              giant UTF-8 specification. <b>Unicode</b> has over 137,000 characters in an attempt to support every language, all scripts, all <br>
              form of communication, including Braille, sign writing, musical notation, and almost 3,000 emoji.</p>
              <p><b>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8&gt;</b></p>
              <p>Include this <b>meta element</b> on every page in our site, inside the <b>head element</b>.</p>

<h1 style="color: darkcyan">Generic Elements: div and span</h1>

<p><b>&lt;div&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>&lt;span&gt;</b></p>
<p><b>DON'T use these for everything. IT'S BAD. It hurts a lot of users.</b></p>
<p>But, sometimes we need a generic element - a div or a span</p>
<p>A <b>div</b> is a block level element.</p>
<p>A <b>span</b> is an inline element.</p>
<p>They both do the same thing: Nothing. Until you point CSS or JavaScript at them.</p>
<p>div and span can take all the Global Attributes: class, id, lang, and aria roles.</p>
<h2>Use Case for div and span:</h2>
<p>We've got a simple article wrapped in an article element. There's a headline and four paragraphs. Perhaps we're writing the CSS for layout and <br>
  we realize we need to put these paragraphs in a group together, so that we can put a background color behind just the paragraphs and not behind <br>
  anything else. So let's add a div with a class of box. I wrote some CSS that targets this box class and you can see it kick in. Let's say we have <br>
  some reason to target a phrase of content in the middle of the text. Some of this content is in Spanish and we want to make sure to change the <br>
  lang attribute for it since it's the sentence in the middle of a paragraph let's use the inline element span to mark the phrase that we want to <br>
  change.</p>

  <h3>Only use div and span when there's not another element that will work - as a last resort.</h3>
